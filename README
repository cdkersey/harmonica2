Harmonica 2
===========

Harmonica 2 is a configurable multithreaded SIMT (single-instruction, multiple
thread) processor core desgin. Its multi-threaded (multi-warp) design enables
it to operate at high throughput without the added complexity of a result
forwarding network, and its SIMT design further improves throughput by running
multiple threads simultaneously on multiple functional units while using only a
single set of control logic. These features are the same ones that make
general-purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs) attractive for a wide range
of applications.

Harmonica 2 is network-based; its pipeline stages are connected using the
routers, arbiters, and buffers provided in the CHDL standard template library.
This feature enables the exploration of novel processor architectures through
simple reconfiguration of the modules provided.
